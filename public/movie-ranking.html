<h2>My top 3 favouite movies </h2>
<hr />
<h3> Inception</h3>
<p> This movie blew my mind when I first watched it and its never stopped since, no matter how many times I go back. It keeps you thinking and questioning reality...whatever that really may be.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p> Maybe I just have a bone to pick with reality, but this movie also questions it and makes us ponder who really is pulling the strings behind it all and if we can trully be free from the puppet masters clutches.</p>
<h3>Split </h3>
<p> I think I just love anything that has to do with the human mind because this movie explores the ominous and mysterious world of split personality disorders and how one can be an entirely different person with in seconds. It explores the idea that if the mind belives in something, the whole body follows suit with that belief to make it a reality.</p>
